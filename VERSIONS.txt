"wx": Version 2.8.10
"visa": 1.8

wx is needed in order to run the GUI. Without it, it is difficult but both the circular
weghing least squares and the final mass calculations have the ability to read a csv
file, and operate on that.

visa is needed to communicate with the instruments, for the automatic gathering of data.
PyVisa 1.8 is not compatible with 1.5 or earlier, but hopefully it maintains backwards
compatibility with 1.8 for a while.
To run visa, the national instruments visa needs to be downloaded
(NIVISA541full_doaloader.exe) as well as the python 
wrapper "pyvisa", can be downloaded using "pip install pyvisa" in the command prompt.
